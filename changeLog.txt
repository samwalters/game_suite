This is the change log for the game_suite. It is used to track progress 
and make notes about current dev status. It mostly serves as a reminder to myself,
where i have left off, and what i plan on working on next.

1/4/15
-not exectuing correctly. seg fault in the draw function. im thinking it has
something to do with memory/scope and pointer logic. next focus should be
making sure the deck will print all shuffled. See "printDeck()" 


9/8/16
-diving back into things in my spare time. note that multivariable declartions
dont seem to work on windows. maybe this has something to do with gcc on
windows. 

	ex int i,j,k = 0; //declares variables but does not set them to 0

9/9/16
-some segfaults due to improper looping were take care of. 

10/7/16
-Check syntax of switch statement, implement global loop

10/21/16
-Figure out way to clear and write from top using ANSI escape codes
-in function playCard, having pointer issues, code does not compile

11/1/16
-should compile okay. need "add card to hand" functionality in war.cpp

11/29/16
-compiles. Need to add stats and graphics to war. also still only going through
the deck once. Cards should move to players hands after wins/loss
